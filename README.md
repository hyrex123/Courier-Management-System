🚚 Courier Management System

Web Application for Internal Logistics Automation at Star Cement Ltd.
A web-based Courier Management System (CMS)** developed during my internship at **Star Cement Ltd., Lumshnong (Meghalaya) to automate and streamline the **end-to-end courier handling process** for employee packages received from e-commerce platforms like **Amazon & Flipkart**.

This system replaces manual tracking with a **secure, role-based, and efficient workflow** for package booking, approval, driver assignment, delivery tracking, and reporting.
